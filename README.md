A light-weight module that aims to make HTTP requests clean, intuitive, reusable and understandable.

## Npm
Not yet published, thinking 'bout calling it "hey-quest" as a joke with "request".

## Goals:

- [ ] Add better examples
- [ ] Separata lib and examples
- [ ] Publish to NPM
- [ ] Get a logo c:
- [ ] Move to Typescript
- [ ] Handle common headers
- [ ] Use babel and maybe a Webpack
- [ ] Be used for the first time! :D
